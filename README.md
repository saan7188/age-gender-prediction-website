Age and Gender Prediction Website

This project is a web-based application that uses deep learning to predict a person's age and gender based on facial images. The web app allows users to upload images for prediction, provides feedback based on prediction results, and allows users to rate the predictions with comments and star ratings.
Features:

    Real-time age and gender prediction: Using pre-trained models for fast and accurate predictions.

    Feedback system: Users can provide feedback through star ratings and comments.

    Web Interface: Built with Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for easy interaction.

    Pre-trained models: Using models trained on large datasets for age and gender classification.

    Result Sharing: Users can share their predictions and feedback with others.

Requirements:

    Python 3.8+

    Flask

    OpenCV

    NumPy

    Flask-WTF

    Flask-SQLAlchemy

    Gunicorn
